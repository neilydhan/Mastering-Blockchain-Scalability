# First Edition 1.0.0

**Title:** *Mastering Blockchain Scalability*
**Author:** Neil Han
**Status:** First-edition release candidate
**Canonical source:** `main` in https://github.com/neilydhan/Mastering-Blockchain-Scalability

This first edition covers the scalability problem from measurement and decentralization constraints through Layer 1 execution, payment channels, rollups, modular architecture, data availability, parallel execution, consensus, and research-to-production evaluation. It includes worked calculations, protocol traces, implementation checklists, exercises, instructor solutions, a glossary, and a practitioner handbook.

## Release Evidence

A distributable release must identify:

- semantic version and UTC build time;
- exact Git commit;
- manuscript word count;
- mdBook and browser versions;
- SHA-256 checksums for the HTML archive and PDF;
- the result of integrity, link, and visual checks;
- the date on which time-sensitive protocol claims were rechecked.

Run `scripts/package-release.sh` from a clean checkout of the intended commit. The script builds HTML and PDF, writes a machine-readable manifest, creates the HTML archive, and writes checksums. It refuses to package a dirty tree so the commit remains a sufficient source identifier.

## Release Review

Version 1.0.0 records the complete technical first-edition scope. The repository includes the final engineering copyedit, citation audit, and representative PDF pixel review. Independent subject-matter and publisher production review remain appropriate for a commercial press edition.

The repository's HTML output is canonical. The PDF is a reproducible print candidate; a printer or publisher may still require changes to trim size, font embedding, color profile, accessibility metadata, and cover production.
