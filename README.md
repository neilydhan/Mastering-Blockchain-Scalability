# Mastering Blockchain Scalability

**A mechanism-first guide to blockchain capacity, security, trust, and recovery.**

Blockchain scalability is a resource and systems problem, not a contest for the largest transactions-per-second number. This book follows transactions and failures end to end across Layer 1, Layer 2, rollups, modular data availability, parallel execution, and consensus. It gives master's students and practitioners worked calculations, explicit security assumptions, threat-model worksheets, benchmark methods, graduate-level exercises, and solution sketches.

## Who This Book Is For

This is a technical systems book for:

- master's students in blockchain, distributed systems, security, and computer architecture;
- lecturers building a graduate blockchain or distributed-systems course;
- protocol engineers working on execution, rollups, data availability, bridges, and consensus;
- founders, architects, researchers, analysts, and developers who need to evaluate scalability claims.

It is not a beginner's introduction to cryptocurrency trading or Web3 applications. Readers should be comfortable with basic data structures, networks, and the idea that a blockchain records signed transactions. Chapter 1 supplies the blockchain foundations needed by readers arriving from adjacent engineering fields.

## Choose a Reading Path

- **Understand the field:** start with the [Preface](chapters/00_preface.md), then Chapters 1-3.
- **Evaluate rollups and modular systems:** read Chapters 5-8, then use the [Threat-Model Worksheets](chapters/16_threat_model_worksheets.md).
- **Study execution and consensus:** read Chapters 9-10 and the worked calculations in each chapter.
- **Compare a protocol or vendor:** use the [Practitioner Evaluation Handbook](chapters/14_evaluation_handbook.md) and [Benchmark Reporting Template](chapters/17_benchmark_reporting_template.md).
- **Build a course:** use the [Instructor and Course Adoption Guide](ACADEMIC.md) with the exercises and solution sketches.

## Cite the Book

Until a DOI is assigned, cite the versioned GitHub release:

> Han, Neil. *Mastering Blockchain Scalability*. Version 1.1.2, 2026. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22257267

Machine-readable citation metadata is in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff). Cite a version-specific release when exact page numbers or claims matter.

## Build the Book

Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) 0.4.52 or a tested compatible release, then run:

```bash
./scripts/build-book.sh
```

The command checks the source, builds the HTML edition into `book/`, and adds book metadata, canonical links, a sitemap, and `robots.txt`. To build the PDF candidate or EPUB:

```bash
./scripts/build-pdf.sh
./scripts/build-epub.sh
```

See the [Publishing Guide](PUBLISHING.md) for the release and visual-review gates.
